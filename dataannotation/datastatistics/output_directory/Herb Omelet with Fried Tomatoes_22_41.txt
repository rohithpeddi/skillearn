Recipe: Herb Omelet with Fried Tomatoes
-----------------------------------------------------
Description: 
Take a tomato and cut it into two pieces.
Heat 1 tbsp oil in a small non-stick frying pan, then cook the tomatoes cut-side down until they start to soften and colour.
Chop 2 tbsp cilantro.
Meanwhile, crack one egg in a bowl and add the chopped cilantro and 1/2 tsp ground black pepper.
Beat the contents of the bowl.
Scoop the tomatoes from the pan and put tomatoes on a serving plate.
Pour the egg mixture into the pan and stir gently with a wooden spoon so the egg that sets on the base of the pan moves to enable the uncooked egg to flow into the space.
Stop stirring when itâ€™s nearly cooked to allow it to set into an omelette.
Transfer it to the plate and serve with the tomatoes.
