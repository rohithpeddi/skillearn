If any have started to set up in the refrigerator, pop it in the microwave for a few seconds to loosen it without making it warm. Fold the cherry jam into 1/3 of the cheesecake base, the sweetened pumpkin into 1/3, and the apple compote into 1/3.

To stack for ultimate stability, use an offset spatula to spread a little of whichever flavor of filling you're stacking on top of to add some fresh mousse to the top. Place the next pie layer directly on top of that fresh mousse, which will stick to the bottom. Make sure the layers are lined up as perfectly as possible before moving on to stack the next layer! When you reach the final layer, no need to add any more filling to it unless it really started to dip down as it."", ""I stacked in the following order: pumpkin-apple-cherry-pumpkin-apple-cherry etc. However, you can and should stack however you like. You will have filling left over, but rejoice! It is super delicious served on its own as a yummy cheesecake mousse."", ""Wrap the layered pie in plastic and put it in the refrigerator at least overnight, at most for 48 hours. It's okay if some of the pie layers crack a little on the sides overnight-as the filling sets, it contracts, which can cause the weight to shift and these fractures can appear. It's alright though, the structural integrity is sound as long as you slice and eat the layered pie within two days."", ""-Make the Leaf Decorations-."", ""Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0.

If you want to go the extra extra mile, dip a very thin brush into black gel color and add veins and an outline to each leaf."", ""-Decorate the Layered Pie-."", ""At most about an hour before serving, melt a handful of white or dark chocolate chips and set aside.

You may feel some resistance, but persevere! Make sure you've cut all the way down to the board."", ""It is important to keep this pie cool at all times, especially once you start cutting pieces out of it, because it will become less stable at room temperature.

Smear the oil again and press."", ""You want to cook the chapatti until you see that all the doughiness is gone and it looks fully cooked. It's ok to have little brown spots on it."", ""It looks delicious and there's nothing like home made chapattis. You can buy these from the store but when you taste these like fresh off the stove it's awesome."", ""And one of the other reasons why it doesn't taste as nice sometimes is a lot of people don't use oil in their chapattis, but I put oil inside the dough and what happens with that is that when you eat the chapatti a little bit later on, it still tastes nice and soft, as supposed to the dough which has been prepared without oil, which tends to turn a little bit chewier."", ""Once the chapatti is cooked I like to keep it in a nice insulated cannister like this. It helps it to stay nice and warm. So you can finish all your chapattis and sit with you family and enjoy your dinner and they'll still be piping hot."", ""note: if u dont wish to use oil on ur chapatis just use a clean cloth to press the chapatis after u have flipped them the second time n press lightly to ensure the air is distributed evenly and the chapatis wud puff up.enjoy !""]",27
