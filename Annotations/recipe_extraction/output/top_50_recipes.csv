sweet-smelling pasta it produces is plumper in body and of a fluffier consistency than any made with durum wheat flour."", ""On the other hand, it requires utmost heedfulness in the cooking, because

kind, but it makes up for it with a body tautly knit and admirably compact."", ""It accepts an extraordinary variety of sauces and cooks to a perfect al dente, firm-to-the-bite consistency."", ""When

rollers are of plastic material with a gritty surface that makes pasta with a livelier texture and better sauce-absorbing qualities; it is electrically driven and faster so that it is both easier to use and kinder to the dough, which wants to be worked as rapidly as possible."", ""No other kinds of machines than these two are suitable for making pasta at home."", ""Those who already own a

""Thinning the dough can be compared to reaching the sidewalk from a buildings sixth story."", ""The fastest way is to jump, but you will be a mass of shattered bones."", ""One of the reasons that pasta made by shops is generally so mediocre is that the dough is flattened all at one time, rather than step by step: its body is smashed, its vital sinew broken, it is inert."", ""Walking down the steps is one safe way: it corresponds to the heedful use of the machines graduated thinning notches."", ""Even less jarring would be to take the elevator: in making pasta, that would be the

made, while it is still soft and sticky."", ""Its softness makes it easier to shape and the stickiness is necessary to produce a tight seal, preventing the stuffing from spilling out during the cooking."", ""For any kind of noodle, however, allow the strips to dry on the towels for 10 minutes or more, depending on the temperature and air circulation of your kitchen."", ""Turn the strips over
