Take a microwavable mug.
Measure the flour (4 tablespoons), baking powder (1/8 teaspoon), baking soda (1/16 teaspoon) and salt (1/8 teaspoon) and add them to a mug.
Stir them.
Add in the milk and oil, then mix. (There might be some lumps, but that is ok.).
Take the marinara sauce and spread it around the surface of the batter.
Cut pepperoni and grate cheese (maybe).
Sprinkle on the cheese, pepperoni, and dried herbs.
Microwave for 1 minute 10 - 1 minute 20 seconds, or until it rises and the toppings are bubbling.
