You have to really dig down to that bottom layer, scraping it off as it hardens and mixing it back in, allowing more of the dressing to sink down and begin to brown.) At this stage, I cook it approximately an hour, scraping the bottom of the pan every 5 minutes or so. Achieving the right texture is critically important, and the best comparison I can think of is to oatmeal. You want it to look like oatmeal does shortly before it's done -- very little excess liquid left, but still easily stirrable and not quite to the final 'thickening' stage.

The overnight version is slightly more pliable and tears less easily than the quicker one which is somewhat less elastic and resembles tortilla dough in its texture. Also, the overnight timing makes a slightly puffier flatbread. The question is rather which bread you prefer and which timing, than which is better.

The sections are used as a guide as you scrape off and flatten sections of dough and place them on top of the pie."", ""5. Butter your fingers. Scrape up a section of pastry dough with the spatula. It will not slide onto the spatula in a flat piece; rather, it will wrinkle and bunch up. Lift the piece off the spatula, roughly flatten it out between your buttered fingers, and place it on top of the pie filling. This step isn't easy to visualize. There are photos illustrating it, as well as other parts of the recipe on the related link."", ""6. Repeat, section by section, until all the round of dough is transferred to the top of the filling, placing the irregular, flattened strips of dough in a single layer over the filling."", ""7. Finally, spread out the flattened segments of pastry gently with your fingers, until the sections meet and cover most of the filling. (But don't labour over the crust too much. Placing a soft crust over a soft filling is not tricky so long as you realize that the crust need not cover every space and will not be a thing of beauty before it is baked. As it bakes, however, the sections of flattened dough will spread out and fill in most of the spaces, and the powdered sugar and almonds used for decorating the baked pie will fill in the remainder."", ""8. Bake the pie in the middle of the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top crust is golden and does not collapse when gently pressed with your finger. Then remove it from the oven and cool the pie in the pan on a rack. Remove the rim of the pan. Lift the pie gently to peel away the parchment paper, or leave it on the parchment paper and slide the pie onto a serving platter."", ""9. Sprinkle the pie with thin-sliced, toasted almonds. Sift powdered sugar over it and, just before serving sift a little more sugar over the pie and place cherries around on the top.
